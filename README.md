# AC-3 for Windows 11
This repository contains a script that helps users bring back Dolby Digital Audio (AC-3, AC-4) support to Windows 11 after the 24H2 update.


Run the **DolbyDigitalAudio_for_Windows_11.ps1** PowerShell script to install AC-3, AC-4 decoders for Windows and Dolby Access app from the Microsoft Store.

**Note: "Dolby AC-4 decoder for PC OEM" is not available for automatic installation so the script opens the Microsoft Store application so you can manually install the decoder.**
